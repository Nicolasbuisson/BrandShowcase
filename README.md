# BrandShowcase - UrbanStyles

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developped a responsive and aesthetic home page for the clothing wear company "UrbanStyles" which I created.

I selected all the pictures from Pexels and designed the layout of the webpage.

The webpage contains a nav bar and image sliders to showcase the products.

The responsive nature of the page is achieved by the use of CSS media queries and the use of the grid and flexbox displays.

The site is deployed at: https://nicolasbuisson.github.io/BrandShowcase---UrbanStyles/
